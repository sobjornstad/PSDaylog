    Email. Sent workgroup info about Request 11111 to fix TFS maintenance
    issues. Prepared notes for the TFS standup later today.

    Looking specifically into Parasoft's suite. Downloaded a trial version of
    their software, Parasoft SOAtest & Virtualize. Trying to figure out how
    to use it; having trouble firing up a test WCF service so I can feed it
    WSDL and play with recording features.

.todo 2018-11-07 09:10 =SamPerformanceTest
    Talk to Sam about the performance testing for Project X that he's been doing,
    as this seems to me like it may have a bearing on our service virtualization
    research and implementation.

    #Research

    Playing more with Parasoft's software and taking notes into "products.txt"
    in my notes about what it is capable of doing. I'm running into a weird
    thing where I can't get it to refresh the currently running virtualized
    service, so it's stuck forever on my initial iteration! In general, it
    seems capable but not impressive; what I saw of SmartBear yesterday seemed
    better to me. (However, that was all working with REST. I need to see how
    it will work with SOAP as well to make a fair comparison.)

    #Research

    Figured out why I was running into problems in @ParasoftRefreshIssue: when
    you publish something as a virtual asset, it ends up hopping over into a
    special folder called VirtualAssets, which then holds a copy of the asset
    which doesn't get updated when you update the main asset!

    This, needless to say, is stupid design and a strike against Parasoft
    Virtualize.

    #Research

    Finished investigating Parasoft's software as far as I want to for my
    immediate purposes. Did a little bit more reading because I realized I
    had bookmarked some things earlier and not gotten through them.

    Will uninstall the software so I don't get dinged on the security reports.
    Can always pull it again if I need to investigate closer; I've gotten all
    I need for now.

    #Research

    Trialing ReadyAPI!. I like it better, that's for sure. However, I am
    having trouble getting it to correctly map values to a data source. I'm
    quite sure this was done yesterday, so I just must be missing the spot
    where you set it up. I'll look more at that after lunch.

    Having integrated testing is pretty slick, and it's a lot nicer than our
    cruddy SoapUI tool. Don't know if we'd want to pay for it for everyone
    who uses SoapUI though...
